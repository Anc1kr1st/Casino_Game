# Casino Game
## Description

The Casino game is a betting game in which the program asks the user to input the cash if he/she wants 
to play and asks the user to select any random number of his choice from 1 to 10. If the number entered 
by the user matches with the number that is generated, then they win the 10x amount of the cash, but if 
it doesnâ€™t match, then the user will lose his/her money.
